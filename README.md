# Dice Roller
This dice roller is a python library build using python. This library is 1st version of dice roller. You can use this library in almost everygame in python game development which uses dice like Monopoly. I know this could be hard for complex games 
This dice roller library have 2 types of dices:
1. Single Dice: uses only 1 dice
2. Double Dice: uses 2 dices

I kept is simple to use and read so the programmers can easily read and check what is going on with the library and how it works.
