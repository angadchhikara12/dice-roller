# Dice Roller
This dice roller is a python library build using python. This library is 1st version of dice roller. You can use this library in almost everygame which uses dice like Monopoly.
This dice roller library have 2 types of dices:
1. Single Dice: uses only 1 dice
2. Double Dice: uses 2 dices

I kept is simple to use and read so the programmers can easily read and check what is going on with the library and how it works.
